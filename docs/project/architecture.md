## Two-Process Model

The MCP server and worker are separate processes sharing the same SQLite database (`{state_dir}/jobs.sqlite`). WAL mode enables concurrent read/write without SQLITE_BUSY errors.

- **MCP server** — started by the MCP client (Claude Code, OpenCode, etc.) via stdio transport. Reads/writes `messages` and `threads` tables. Inserts queued rows into the `executions` table when dispatching to worker agents.
- **Worker** — long-running background process. Polls the `executions` table for `status='queued'` rows, claims work atomically with per-agent concurrency enforcement, runs backend triggers via `tokio::task::spawn_blocking`, and writes reply messages back.

## Project/State Paths

`compas` uses two distinct filesystem roots:

- `default_workdir`: the default working directory where backend CLIs run commands/tasks.
- `state_dir`: orchestrator-owned runtime state (DB/logs/heartbeats).

This separation allows one shared orchestrator binary/config model to work across unrelated repositories.

## Database Schema

Six tables in a single SQLite file with WAL mode:

| Table | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `threads` | Thread lifecycle (Active, Completed, Failed, Abandoned) |
| `messages` | Conversation ledger between operator and agents |
| `executions` | Job queue AND execution lifecycle tracker (queued → picked_up → executing → completed/failed/timed_out/crashed/cancelled) |
| `worker_heartbeats` | Worker liveness tracking |
| `execution_events` | Structured telemetry events extracted from backend output |
| `merge_operations` | Merge queue: FIFO queue for worktree branch integration, serialized per target branch |

The `executions` table is the single source of truth for both queuing and execution state — no separate job queue system.

## Dispatch Flow

When `orch_dispatch` is called:

1. Message inserted into `messages` table (thread auto-created if needed)
2. If intent matches `trigger_intents` config AND target agent role is `Worker`:
   - Execution row inserted into `executions` table with `status='queued'`
   - Worker picks it up on next poll cycle via `claim_next_execution()`
   - Worker resolves agent config → backend → starts session
   - Backend CLI process spawned inside `tokio::task::spawn_blocking`
   - All agent replies get `response` intent (agents reply naturally, no intent parsing)
   - Execution status updated (completed/failed/timed_out)
   - Reply message inserted into `messages` table
   - If agent has `on_response` handoff config, a new `handoff` message is auto-inserted targeting the next agent, triggering a new execution on the next poll cycle. When `on_response` is a list (fan-out), a separate batch-linked thread is created per target agent. Chain depth is tracked by counting `handoff` messages on the thread; when `max_chain_depth` is reached, a review-request to the operator is inserted instead.

## Worker Lifecycle

On startup:

1. **Crash recovery** — marks orphaned executions (`picked_up`/`executing`) as `crashed`, marks orphaned merge operations as `failed`, cleans up orphaned merge worktrees
2. **Initial heartbeat** — writes to `worker_heartbeats` table

Main loop (concurrent via `tokio::select!`):

- **Poll interval** — claims queued executions, enforces per-agent concurrency via SQL, spawns execution tasks with global semaphore
- **Merge poll interval** — claims queued merge operations, executes in temporary worktrees via `spawn_blocking`, per-target-branch serialization
- **Heartbeat interval** (10s) — writes liveness record for `orch_health` to check

## Execution Status Lifecycle

```text
queued → picked_up → executing → completed
                               → failed (transient) → re-queued (retry backoff)
                               → failed (non-retryable / retries exhausted)
                               → timed_out
                               → crashed (worker died mid-execution)
                    → cancelled (thread abandoned)
```

## Agent Roles

- **Worker** (default) — triggered when dispatch intent matches `trigger_intents`. The worker spawns CLI processes via `spawn_blocking` to execute work.
- **Operator** — MCP-only, never triggered. The operator is whoever calls the MCP tools.

## Key Design Decisions

- **Custom `executions` table as job queue** — single source of truth for both queuing and execution lifecycle. No external job queue dependency.
- **`spawn_blocking` for CLI execution** — backend trigger calls run inside `tokio::task::spawn_blocking` to avoid starving the async runtime with blocking subprocess I/O.
- **Per-agent concurrency enforcement** — `claim_next_execution()` uses a SQL subquery to check active execution count per agent before claiming work.
- **Crash recovery on startup** — worker marks orphaned `picked_up`/`executing` rows as `crashed` on startup, preventing lost work from going unnoticed.
- **WAL mode mandatory** — SQLite WAL mode enables the two-process model (MCP server + worker) to read/write concurrently without SQLITE_BUSY errors.
- **200ms DB polling for wait** — `wait_for_message()` polls at 200ms intervals. Exposed via `compas wait` CLI subcommand. Removed from MCP surface (stdio transport timeouts made it unreliable).
- **Six tables** — `threads` (lifecycle), `messages` (conversation ledger), `executions` (job queue + execution tracker), `worker_heartbeats` (liveness), `execution_events` (telemetry), `merge_operations` (merge queue).
- **Retry via store re-enqueue** — failed executions with transient errors are retried by inserting a new queued execution with a `retry_after` timestamp. The poll loop claims retries only when the backoff expires. No synchronous sleep.
- **Execution telemetry via line-level channel** — backend stdout lines flow through a `sync_channel(128)` from the reader thread to a tokio consumer that parses JSONL and batch-inserts events.
- **Auto-handoff chains** — config-driven agent-to-agent routing via `on_response`. All agent replies get `response` intent automatically (no agent-side intent parsing). Chain depth is tracked by counting `handoff`-intent messages on the thread. Depth check and handoff insert run in a single SQL transaction to prevent TOCTOU races. Forced operator escalation at `max_chain_depth` (default: 3).
- **Fan-out via batch-linked threads** — when `on_response` is a list, each target agent gets its own thread, all sharing a batch ID. Operator is the join point; `orch_batch_status` aggregates results. Parallel execution, not same-thread concurrency (ADR-014).
- **Merge queue with per-target-branch serialization** — merge operations are queued in SQLite, executed in temporary worktrees (never the operator's checkout), serialized per target branch. See ADR-019.
